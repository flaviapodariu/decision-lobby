# Decision Lobby

## Problem statement
When a group of people tries to decide on something, it usually ends in disagreements or even arguments. This results not only in loss of productivity, but it can also create issues for the people involved.

Currently, the most used methods for taking decisions in a group are a simple raising of the hand for the option you prefer, or just choosing randomly from one of the options. However, these methods do not place any restrictions on the number of choices a person can make or do not accurately represent the preferences of the people in the group. These methods in their current form transform taking a decision into an inconvenience and it should be done differently.

The making of a decision should be a fun activity for the group through the usage of an application that each member will use to choose their preference through a range of minigames that are visually pleasing, fun to play and can accurately display the results in order for everyone to be satisfied.
